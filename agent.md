## Summary of Work
- Scaffolded a React + Vite project (`npm create vite@latest`) and installed baseline dependencies per PRD.
- Established clean architecture directories: `domain`, `application`, `ui`, `effects`, `infrastructure`, `shared`, `test`.
- Implemented starter domain entity helpers for Sudoku boards and an application-level `gameService` that consumes a memory puzzle repository.
- Wired the UI layer to depend on injected application services, created a placeholder board view, and refreshed global/ component styles to match PRD tone.
- Added an effects hook stub (`useCelebrationEffect`) to separate celebratory animations/sounds from UI logic.
- Configured ESLint with `eslint-plugin-boundaries` to enforce layer rules and extended Vitest setup with JSDOM, coverage defaults, and shared test bootstrap.
- Replaced README with project-specific documentation and updated package metadata.
- Verified tooling with `npm run lint` and `npm run test` (1 passing domain test).

## Todo / Next Steps
1. Replace `createMemoryPuzzleRepository` with a data-backed implementation (static JSON now, extensible for future algorithm/service integration).
2. Model core game state transitions (selection, input, notes, validation) in the Application layer and expose typed interfaces for the UI.
3. Integrate a state store adapter (e.g., Zustand) per PRD, keeping Domain/Application pure.
4. Expand Domain test coverage (validation, completion detection, undo stack) to reach 70%+ targets.
5. Flesh out Effects layer: animation hooks (board highlights, completion celebration), sound/haptic opt-in handling respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`.
6. Build responsive/mobile UX elements including number pad, accessibility labels, and dark mode verification.
7. Introduce persistence adapters (local storage for progress/settings) under Infrastructure with accompanying tests.
8. Set up GitHub Actions workflow for lint/test, and ensure Vite `base` config matches GitHub Pages deployment.
9. Document interface contracts in `shared` (types, event channels) to guide future AI or teammate contributions.
